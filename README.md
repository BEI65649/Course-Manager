App Name: Course Manager

Description: This app is for users at universities needing to build out their course database. The app will allow users to create a course. The use will be able to add the campus location where the course will be available. The user will also be able to assign a professor to the course. 

Background info: I built this app, because I recently applied for Software developer job at a university, so I wanted to do something that is tied to a unviersity. This project is my way of speaking things into existence.
